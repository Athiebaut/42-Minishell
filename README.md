Minishell

Minishell is a major system programming project that focuses on building a minimal Unix shell from scratch.
The project aims to provide a deep understanding of how command-line interpreters work internally and how users interact with an operating system through a shell.

We explore through this project the full lifecycle of command execution, from user input parsing to process creation and management, while handling the interaction between commands, the environment, and the operating system. The project emphasizes translating human-readable commands into structured execution flows that the system can understand and execute reliably.

Minishell highlights essential concepts such as process control, file descriptor management, signal handling, and environment state management. It requires careful architectural decisions to ensure that parsing, execution, and state handling remain cleanly separated and maintainable over time.
